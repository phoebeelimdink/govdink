GitHub is your gateway to editing your Isomer website. Before you can edit your Isomer site, you must create a GitHub account and be assigned the proper permissions. Already have a GitHub account with edit permissions on your site? Skip to the [next step](/tutorial/firstedit/editing/).

### Sign up

Go to <https://github.com/>{:target="_blank"}. Proceed to sign up for an account using your preferred email address and a professional username. The email address used must be connected to the internet.

### Select the free plan

You will only need a basic account on GitHub to edit the content of your Isomer website.

Under 'Choose your subscription', select 'Free' to opt for the free plan.

Click on 'Continue' when the correct option is selected.

### Go to your settings

After verification, you will need to do some additional set-up.

Go to your account settings by clicking on your profile picture on the top right hand corner of the page.

Select 'Settings' and you will be redirected to a new page.

On the left-hand side of the page, look for the 'Security' tab and select it. Here, we will be setting up two-factor authentication (2FA).

### Enable 2FA

Before working on Isomer websites, you will have to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure your account. Note that 2FA is required for all Isomer repositories.

Click on ‘Enable two-factor authentication’ to proceed.

### Choose 2FA authentication method

Select a 2FA authentication method. You have a choice between using an app (such as [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), [Authy](https://authy.com/), or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)), or via an SMS message.

### Save your recovery codes

GitHub will prompt you to save your recovery codes. The purpose of these codes are to gurantee you are the owner of your account in case your 2FA fails, such as when you lose your phone.

We strongly encourage saving these codes somewhere secure.

After selecting one of the methods to save the codes, the 'Next' button will be enabled. Proceed.

### Complete 2FA setup

Set up your 2FA as prompted by GitHub. You'll be prompted for a 'trial run' of your 2FA, where you must enter the generated 2FA code to make sure that your 2FA setup is working in order to proceed. Once done, click 'Enable' to enable 2FA on your account.

You will then see a banner notifying you that 'Two-factor authentication successfully enabled'.

Now you are ready to gain access to your Isomer website repository.

### Request an invite

Now that your account is all set up. You will need an invite to make edits to your website.

To gain access, email the Isomer Team at <admin@isomer.gov.sg> with your GitHub username and website.

Upon being added to the repository, you will receive an invite on your registered email.
